Text::Templet
=============

Text::Templet implements a very efficient and fast template 
processor that allows you to embed Perl variables and snippets of Perl 
code directly into HTML, XML or any other text. Text::Templet is uniquie 
in that it employs Perl's eval() function for features that other 
template systems implement using regular expressions, introducing a whole 
new syntax, with complexity proportional to the system's sophistication. 
Text::Templet uses Perl syntax for all its functionality, which greatly 
simplifies and speeds up processing of the template.
